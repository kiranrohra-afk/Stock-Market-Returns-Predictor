# Stock Market Returns Predictor
## Introduction

An ETF or Exchange- Traded Fund is an investment fund that lets you buy
a large basket of individual stocks or government and corporate bonds in
one purchase. Due to their low risks, investing money in an ETF is a
common choice for beginner investors who want exposure to the stock
market. Accurately predicting the fund return of an ETF can help
investors make informed decisions regarding what they should put their
money into. The goal of our final project is to find a model that
accurately predicts the 3 year fund return of an ETF as well as the
characteristics of an ETF with high returns. Our aim is that, if a
consumer has the following information on an ETF, they can choose
whether or not to buy a particular ETF based on its predicted return and
compare returns with other ETFs. We will be investigating the following
predictor variables in our study:

Size type: Whether the ETF is from a small, medium sized or large cap
company

Fund yield: income return on the investment in the ETF as a percentage,
typically includes dividends and interest earned by the assets held in
the ETF

Investment Type: Growth, Value or Blend are different investment
strategies of all the ETFs in this analysis. Growth focuses on companies
expected to grow significantly faster than the market, often reinvesting
profits rather than paying dividends. Value targets undervalued
companies with strong fundamentals, trading at lower price-to-earnings
ratios, and often providing dividends. Blend combines both growth and
value stocks, offering a diversified portfolio that balances potential
high returns with lower risk.

Fund Sharpe ratio 3 years: The 3-year Sharpe ratio evaluates a fund's
risk-adjusted performance over the past three years by comparing its
excess returns to the volatility of those returns. A high Sharpe ratio
indicates that the investment has delivered higher returns per unit of
risk, suggesting more efficient performance relative to the risk taken.
A low Sharpe ratio suggests that the investment has provided lower
returns relative to the risk taken, indicating less efficient
performance.

Fund Treynor ratio 3 years: The 3-year Treynor ratio measures a fund's
return above the risk-free rate per unit of market risk, indicating how
well it has compensated investors for taking on market risk over the
past three years. A high Treynor ratio indicates that a fund has
provided high returns relative to the amount of market risk it has taken
on, suggesting efficient performance in compensating investors for
market risk.

The Sharpe ratio measures return per unit of total risk (volatility),
while the Treynor ratio measures return per unit of market risk. The
Sharpe ratio evaluates the overall risk-adjusted performance, while the
Treynor ratio focuses on systematic risk relative to the market.

Price Book Ratio: The fund price-to-book ratio compares the market price
of a fund's shares to its book value per share, indicating how much
investors are willing to pay for each dollar of net assets.

Price Cashflow Ratio: The fund price-to-cash-flow ratio measures a
fund's market price per share relative to its cash flow per share,
indicating how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of cash
generated by the fund.

5 Year Mean Annual Return: The 5-Year Mean Annual Return represents the
average annual percentage return of an investment over a 5-year period.
